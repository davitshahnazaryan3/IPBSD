0. Before starting IPBSD we need:
	Performance objectives
		MAFC target
		EAL limit
	Building information
		Material properties
		Global dimensions (heights and span widths)
		Lateral load resisting system configuration
		Gravity loads
		Damping ratio
		Replacement Cost of building
	Storey Loss Functions

1. Establish loss curve through the adjustment of Limit state parameters (ELR and MAFE), Fig1
	Area under loss curve should be <= EALlimit
	Output: ySLS

2. Establish design EDPs from ySLS and SLFs, Fig2a
	Output: theta and a
	Iteration: if iteration occurred (EDPNS != EDPS for example)
		using the critical of thetas and alphas recompute y values, Fig2b
		Recompute ySLS using the new y values
		Regenerate the loss curve and compare area under curve to EALlimit, Fig2c
		If condition not met or undesired by the practitioner (e.g., too low compared to EALlimit), re-establish limit state parameters and repeat steps 1 to 2.

3. Transform the design values (theta and a) to spectral coordiantes, i.e. delta and alpha (DBD procedures may be used)

4. Get spectrum at SLS, Fig 3a

5. Using the spectrum at SLS and the spectral coordinates establish the lower and upper period range, Fig3b, Fig3c

6. Assume a backbone curve shape, T1 and Omega, Fig4a
	Use SPO2IDA to estimate the collapse fragility function
	Solve for cy. Use cy as a variable to satisfy MAFC == MAFCtarget
		Using the fragility function integrate with the established hazard function to compute MAFC, Fig4b

### Start Design and Detailing

7. Run Modal Analysis and compute modal properties

8. Run static analysis (lateral or RSMA + gravity) and detail the structural elements

9. Run SPO analysis to verify the correctness of the backbone shape assumption
	If not satisfactory repeat steps 6 to 9
	If ok - design and detailing complete
