### Future upgrade objectives<a id='future'>

* [ ] Design of structural elements based on critical combination of M+N, M-N etc.

* [ ] Add class of reinforcement and concrete as input arguments

* [ ] Add softening slope by Vecchio and Collins 1986

* [ ] All input xlsx, csv etc. files will be modified to be more flexible

* [ ] Add explanations on how and in which format to provide the inputs for the software

* [ ] Reinforced concrete moment-resisting frame -> Steel MRF, other typologies to be included

* [ ] 3 Performance objective limit states -> flexible for inclusion

* [ ] Homogeneous storey-loss-functions along the height -> flexible for inclusion

* [ ] SPO2IDA tool for collapse fragility definition -> ML algorithms to avoid being limited to using SPO2IDA, needs extensive studies and analysis, possible data collection

* [ ] Symmetric structures only -> add considerations for 3D models

* [ ] Single conversion factor for peak floor accelerations -> study based on Antonio's work to include regressions

* [ ] Code-based overstrength factors indirectly accounted for -> flexible to include

* [ ] Same beam cross-sections along the height/no grouping for beams -> add grouping once generic opensees model is updated to account for it

* [ ] Considerations for shear design, will be useful also in identifying inelastic rotation capacities, then input ro_sh based on that for Haselton platic hinge length definition
